LaTeX Table Creator
===================

The LaTeX Table Creator is an application that allows the user to input data into a grid and export the contents to LaTeX syntax given a few options. The program is not a WYSIWYG interface and certainly does not provide a complete set of options. This program is for quick conversions of table data into either table or matrix LaTeX code. It does offer copy and paste capabilities within the program and between the program and most spreadsheets (tab delimited text transfer). In addition, there are several options for populating the grid, transposing, resizing, inserting and deleting rows and columns, undo and redo, and file saving and loading of the data grid.
