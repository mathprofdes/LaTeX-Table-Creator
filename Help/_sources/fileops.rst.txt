File Options
============

The file options allow you to save and load table information. The saving and loading of table information is just on the current table itself, the undo and redo history is not saved.

New
---

The New option will open another copy of the program with a blank grid.

Open
----

The Open option will open a table data file. When a file is opened it will replace the current table with the saved one. The undo/redo history is not cleared so the table that is overwritten is still in the history. The data files are stored in binary format and cannot be edited with an outside editor.

Save As...
----------

The Save As... option will save the current table to a table data file. Saving will save only the current table and not the history. The data files are stored in binary format and cannot be edited with an outside editor.
