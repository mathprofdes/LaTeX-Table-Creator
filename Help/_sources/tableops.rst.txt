Table Options
=============

The table options allow you to manipulate the data grid. Adding and deleting rows and columns, adjusting of cell sizes, and a few specialized operations.

Adding Rows and Columns
-----------------------

Adding rows and columns will insert a row or column either before or after the selected region. There must be at least one cell currently selected on the grid or no row or column will be inserted. If multiple cells are selected the added row will be added directly above or below the selected block of cells. The same is true for added columns.

Deleting Rows and Columns
-------------------------

When deleting rows or columns, the program will delete all of the rows or columns in the selected region. Again at least one cell must be selected for any rows or columns to be deleted.

Selections and Clearing
-----------------------

Select All will, as you would expect, select all the cells in the grid. The Clear All option will remove all data from the grid. Note that this does not clear the grid history. So if you mistakenly clear the grid an undo will bring the data back.

Cell Size Adjustments
---------------------

The automatic size adjustments will adjust the row height and column widths to match the data in the grid. The default size on startup and when adding rows or columns may not fit the contents of the cells, these options will make those adjustments.

Grid Manipulation Options
-------------------------

The Table menu has several manipulation options that come in handy from time to time.

* The Transpose option will transpose the grid, that is, turn rows to columns and columns to rows.
* The Trim option will remove any leading and trailing spaces for each data item in the grid.
* The Fill option will allow the user to input some text and it will fill all selected cells with that text.
